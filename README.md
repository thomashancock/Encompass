# Encompass
A simple game about placing beads. Written for python3 with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

To run, simply execute the Encompass.py script, or the ``run.sh'' shell script.

Have fun!

## Rules

The aim of the game is to surround one of your opponent's beads in all cardinal directions.

On your turn, you may:
- Place a bead in an empty space
- Remove two beads, one of each colour

All the beads on the grid may be moved together if there is empty space for them to move into. This does not take a turn.

If the grid is filled without a winner, each player takes it in turns removing an opponent's bead until six have been removed, and then play continues as normal.

## Controls

Beads are selected and placed by clicking on them/the empty grid space.

The beads can be collectively moved by clicking outside the grid in the direction you wish to move them.
